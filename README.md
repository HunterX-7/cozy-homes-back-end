<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Project Name

## Cozy Homes Backend API

## About this project

 
This web platform has been meticulously designed to offer users the ability to explore a diverse selection of houses, 
providing them with the freedom to reserve properties based on their preferences. Additionally, users can also leverage 
the platform to list their own properties, allowing other users to reserve them and generate extra income.
To access the full range of features, users are encouraged to register an account, which grants them exclusive access to the website's 
functionalities using a unique username. The application comprises two main components: the cozy-homes-back-end and the cozy-homes-front-end.
The cozy-homes-back-end houses the API backend, responsible for managing and retrieving data from the database in response to requests made by the frontend.
This component is built using the robust Ruby on Rails API framework, ensuring a secure and efficient backend infrastructure.

On the other hand, the cozy-homes-front-end encompasses the captivating user interface of the website, providing an intuitive platform where users can 
seamlessly interact with the database. Developed using cutting-edge technologies such as ReactJS and Redux, the frontend offers a seamless and engaging user experience.
With the powerful combination of a Ruby on Rails API backend and a dynamic ReactJS and Redux frontend, this web application delivers a compelling and 
feature-rich platform for users to explore, reserve, and list properties with utmost convenience and efficiency.
